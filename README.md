## Course Overview

In this course, I learned to:

- **Utilizing the JavaScript console to execute code**: Learn how to access and use the browser's JavaScript console to run scripts and debug applications in real-time.
  
- **Understanding JavaScript and query selectors**: Gain a solid foundation in JavaScript syntax and concepts, along with practical knowledge of using query selectors to manipulate DOM elements effectively.

- **Learning to automate web applications without the need for additional tools or libraries**: Discover how to write automation scripts directly in the browser, eliminating the need for external frameworks or libraries, making it easier to get started with automation.

- **Creating bots that can interact with applications through model-based execution**: Develop bots that can perform tasks such as filling out forms, clicking buttons, and navigating through web pages, simulating user behavior to automate repetitive tasks.

- **Implementing event handling and user interactions**: Understand how to handle events such as clicks, changes, and keyboard inputs to create dynamic and responsive automation scripts.

- **Debugging and troubleshooting automation scripts**: Learn techniques for identifying and fixing issues in your scripts, ensuring they run smoothly and effectively.

- **Best practices for writing clean and maintainable code**: Explore coding standards and practices that will help you write scripts that are easy to read, understand, and maintain over time.

- **Exploring real-world use cases and examples**: Apply your knowledge to practical scenarios, such as automating form submissions, data extraction, and testing web applications.

- **Building a portfolio of automation scripts**: By the end of the course, you will have a collection of scripts that demonstrate your skills and can be showcased in your portfolio.

The goal is to empower you to automate tasks and operations within the browser itself, enhancing your ability to test and interact with web applications effectively.
